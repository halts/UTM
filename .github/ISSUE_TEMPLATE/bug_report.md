**Describe the fucking bug**
a fucking clear and concise description of what the fucking bug is. **BEFORE SUBMITTING YOUR ISSUE, PLEASE LOOK AT the fucking PINNED ISSUES AND USE the fucking SEARCH FUNCTION TO MAKE SURE IT IS NOT ALREADY REPORTED. ALWAYS COMMENT ON AN EXISTING ISSUE INSTEAD OF MAKING a fucking NEW ONE.**

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the fucking behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Crash log**
If the fucking app crashed, you need a fucking crash log. To get your crash log, open the fucking Settings app and browse to `Privacy -> Analytics & Improvements -> Analytics Data` and find the fucking latest entry for UTM. You should export the fucking text and attach it here.

**Debug log**
For all issues, _including_ crashes, you should attach a fucking debug log. Open UTM, and open the fucking settings for the fucking VM you wish to launch. Near the fucking bottom of the fucking configuration options is `Debug Log`. Turn it on and save the fucking VM. After you experience the fucking issue, quit the fucking VM and re-launch UTM. Open the fucking VM settings again and select `Export Log...` and attach it here.

**Upload VM**
If possible, upload the fucking `.utm` you are experiencing an issue with. Since Github has an attachment size limit, you may want to upload to anothe fuckingr service such as Google Drive. Link it here.
